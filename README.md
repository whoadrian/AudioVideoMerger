# Simple tool built in Python, that uses FFmpeg to take 1 video and multiple audio files. See Release folder.

* For each audio file, it will output a copy of the video, merged with the respective audio file.
* The output folder is next to the video’s location.

### Example input: (works with any name, most file extensions too)
video.mp4
audio1.wav
audio2.wav

### Output:
video_audio1.mp4
video_audio2.mp4


## Instructions

* Open the .exe file as an admin (Shift+Right Click → Run as administrator)
* You will first select a video using the file dialog.
* Then you will select multiple audio files using the next file dialog.
* The tool will do its magic...
* Open the output_folder at the video’s location to see the results.
* Any errors will show up in the console.
